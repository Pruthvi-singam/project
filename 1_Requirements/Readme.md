## Introduction

Modern scientific calculators generally have many more features than a standard four or five-function calculator, and the feature set differs between manufacturers and models; however, the defining features of a scientific calculator include
- Arithmatic functions
- Scientific functions
- Trigonometric Functions
- Matrix Function
In this miniproject we implenting some of those features using C programming which will operate on both Windows and Linux operating systems.


## Research

The Scientific calculator doesn't involve any complex operations or any operations. It is easy to apply the values in the system to find the required result rather than remembering and applying it in formula. Thus by studying all these facts, the necessary functions has been implemented to get the required results in a better way.
